# Personal Portfolio

This project is a personal professional portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and interests as a developer. The site was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted with GitHub Pages.

It highlights my background, technical skills, and selected work in a clean, responsive layout, with a focus on usability and modern web design. Through this project, I practiced front-end development fundamentals, version control with GitHub, and deploying a live website.

This portfolio represents my ability to design, build, and publish a complete web project from start to finish.
